It is a pleasure to meet you here, my friend from afar. First of all, I have to say hello to you. Hey, how are you?

I'm Wren Fan, a front-end programmer currently learning JS, TS, Vue, etc.

Although it's a bit late for the Internet industry, there's a saying that "the best time to plant a tree is ten years ago, followed by now"

Maybe the seeds were planted and I grew up with a newfound interest in things and a desire to figure them out.
